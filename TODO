*  Unit testing code (using all the various methods of partitioning), testing 0-1 lossMat, etc.

*  Vignette and documentation edits:  
    make sure references to partitions make sense:  test sets are non-overlapping, but training sets are not.
    discuss stratified sampling

* Intelligent stopifnot() call to give understandable messages

* After testing, Remove commented code in single_LRCglmnet.R
