*  Unit testing code (using all the various methods of partitioning), testing 0-1 lossMat, etc.

*  Vignette and documentation edits:  
    in intro, make it clear that tuning parameters are chosen by minimizing loss via cross validation
    elastic net is hyphenated
    update likelihood to match the one shown in the glmnet documentation
    make sure references to partitions make sense:  test sets are non-overlapping, but training sets are not.
    discuss stratified sampling

* rename the package to glmnetLRC and the main function to glmnetLRC

* Intelligent stopifnot() call to give understandable messages

* recreate LRCglmnet_fit

* After testing, Remove commented code in single_LRCglmnet.R
