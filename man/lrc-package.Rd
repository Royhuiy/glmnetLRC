\title{Logistic regression classification (LRC) with an arbitrary loss function}
\description{
Logistic regression classification (LRC) with an arbitrary loss function
and variable selection via elastic net (glmnet)
}
\details{
\pkg{lrc} extends the \pkg{glmnet} 
package for training elastic net LRCs with a user-specified
discrete loss function.

There are a handful of functions you'll need (along with their associated methods):
\code{\link{lossMatrix}}, \code{\link{LRCglmnet}}, 
and \code{\link{predict.LRCglmnet}}
}
